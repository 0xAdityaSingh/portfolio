            I am a graduate student in Computer Science and Biosciences Department at IIIT Delhi (2022 Batch). Because of my interests, I got into Computer Science Engineering where I explored Programming, Data Science, Bioinformatics, etc. and my whole perspective about the world of computer science widened beyond what I imagined. My involvement in a bunch of fields gave me varied skillsets in Product design and Software/Web development.
